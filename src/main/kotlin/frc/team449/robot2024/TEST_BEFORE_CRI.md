**Drive Things to do**
* Recharacterize it (preferably with the climbers on)
* Try kraken drive if we have it??

**Shooter things to do**
* Create a good apriltag setup on the speaker
* Try collecting a shooter angle map for vision (the movement has been slowed down and tolerances are much more relaxed)
* Fix pivot backlash to mitigate oscillation
* Ensure that the vision shot pivot movement shows NO signs of oscillation

**Misc things to do**
* **IMPORTANT**: Flash the radio firmware to version 1.2.1
* Try out the new controller bindings
* Single tag vision has been enabled, lower the stddevs once you get comfortable with it
